We agreed that you have exhausted non-operative management for your knee osteoarthritis and I have listed you for total knee replacement. I explained that this procedure involves either a general or a regional anaesthetic. You will have a scar on the front of your knee and we will replace the diseased bone with a metallic implant and polyethylene insert. The risks of surgery include pain, scar, infection, bleeding, damage to nerves/vessels/muscle/tendon, stiffness, swelling, failure to improve your symptoms, dissatisfaction, fracture, the need for further surgery, blood clots in the leg or the lungs, and the risks from the anaesthetic. You will be seen in the Pre-Assessment clinic to determine your fitness for surgery. I have referred you to our Joint School, where you will receive more information and have the opportunity to ask any further questions. I have also provided you with an information booklet on joint replacement, which I would like you to return when you attend for surgery. Finally, I have referred you to the Versus Arthritis programme "Let's move for surgery". This provides information on recommended exercises before and after surgery: https://www.versusarthritis.org/about-arthritis/exercising-with-arthritis/lets-move-for-surgery-toolkit

I look forward to seeing you in due course.
